Hello! This is my third and (not-so) final project for the Athena Awards. This project was made to complete my HTML, CSS, Javascript website trio I have going on (my first website was mostly html, my second mostly css, and my third mostly javascript), and to do this before I go and make a visual novel with Ren.PY or somthing. 
This website was pretty challenging for me because I haven't done much work with Javascript before. However I learned a lot, through a lot of trial and error + google/

This project is mostly a personal project because the array of shows it uses are pretty specific to shows I just like. You can generate a show from any of the shows, or click on one of the images of the show to go and generate episodes for that one specifically.
Very simple stuff, just took a while because I am new and a little bit silly
I learned a pretty decent amount of stuff using Javascript, and am now able to generate a random number and use if statements, as well as learn more difficult stuff
