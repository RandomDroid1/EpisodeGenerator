Hello! This is my third and (not-so) final project for the Athena Awards. This project was made as a relatively quick thing to expand my knowledge of javascript before I move to my longer-term project of making a visual novel with Ren.Py. This website
was pretty challenging for me because I haven't done much work with Javascript before. However I learned a lot, and am ready for the future (damn I sound like a politician or something, I can sell this)

This project is mostly a personal project because the array of shows it uses are pretty specific to shows I just like. You can generate a show from any of the shows, or click on one of the images of the show to go and generate episodes for that one specifically.
Very simple stuff, just took a while because I am new and a little bit silly
I learned a pretty decent amount of stuff using Javascript, and am now able to generate a random number and use if statements, as well as learn more difficult stuff
